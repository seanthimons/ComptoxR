\title{Extract molecular formulas from text}
\usage{
extract_formulas(text_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{text_vector}{A character vector of text to search.}
}
\value{
A list of character vectors. Each element corresponds to one input
string and contains all formulas found inside its bracketed content.
}
\description{
Finds and returns chemically valid molecular formulas from a character vector,
restricted to content inside parentheses or square brackets.
}
\details{
Behavior:
\itemize{
\item Correctly handles parentheses, square brackets, stoichiometric numbers, and
grouped substructures (e.g., "(NH3)2").
\item Recognizes complexes and hydrates inside brackets when they include spaces,
middle dot (U+00B7), plus/minus, or periods (these are normalized before validation).
\item Ignores oxidation state Roman numerals in brackets, e.g., "(III)" or "( ii )".
\item Excludes carbon backbone ranges like "C9-12".
}
}
\examples{
texts <- c(
  "Water (H2O) and ethanol (C2H5OH).",
  "Complex: [Pt(NH3)2Cl2] catalyst.",
  "Hydrate: (CuSO4 . 5H2O)",
  "Oxidation state: iron (III) chloride",  # "(III)" is ignored
  "Backbone range: C9-12 alcohols"         # "C9-12" is ignored
)
extract_formulas(texts)
