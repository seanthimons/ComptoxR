\title{Generates an Excel workbook containing information on all Analytical QC records that contain a given list of DTXSIDs.}
\usage{
chemi_amos_analytical_qc_batch(
  base_url = NULL,
  dtxsids = NULL,
  include_classyfire = NULL,
  include_functional_uses = NULL,
  include_source_counts = NULL,
  methodologies = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_url}{URL for the AMOS frontend.  Used to construct the internal links in the output file.}

\item{dtxsids}{List of DTXSIDs to search for.}

\item{include_classyfire}{Flag for whether to include the top four levels of a ClassyFire classification for each of the searched substances, if it exists.}

\item{include_functional_uses}{Flag for whether to include functional use classifications based on the ChemFuncT ontology.  Only exists for around 21,000 substances in the database.}

\item{include_source_counts}{Flag for whether to include counts of a substance's appearances in patents, PubMed articles, and other external sources.}

\item{methodologies}{Filters the returned results by analytical methodologies.  This argument should be a dictionary with four keys with boolean values -- "all", "GC/MS", "LC/MS", and "NMR".  There are some methodologies with small numbers of records (e.g., IR spectra) which will only appear in the data if "all" is set to true.}
