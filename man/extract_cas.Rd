\title{Extracts all valid CASRNs from a character vector}
\usage{
extract_cas(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector of text to be searched.}
}
\value{
A list of character vectors. Each element of the list corresponds
to an element of the input \code{x} and contains all valid CASRNs found.
An empty \code{character(0)} vector indicates no valid CASRNs were found for
that input string.
}
\description{
This function searches for and extracts all valid Chemical Abstracts Service
Registry Numbers (CASRNs) from a character vector. It uses a flexible
pattern to find candidate strings (including those without hyphens) and then
validates each one using the \code{as_cas()} coercion and validation function.
}
\examples{
text <- c(
  "The CAS for formaldehyde is 50-00-0, and water is 7732-18-5.",
  "An invalid number is 50-00-1, but a padded one is 007732-18-5.",
  "No hyphens: 50000.",
  "No valid CASRNs in this string.",
  NA
)
