\title{Generates an Excel workbook which lists all records in the database that contain a given set of DTXSIDs.}
\usage{
chemi_amos_batch(
  additional_record_info = NULL,
  always_download_file = NULL,
  base_url = NULL,
  dtxsids = NULL,
  include_classyfire = NULL,
  include_external_links = NULL,
  include_functional_uses = NULL,
  include_source_counts = NULL,
  methodologies = NULL,
  record_types = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{additional_record_info}{Optional parameter}

\item{always_download_file}{If false, a search that does not find any matching records in the database will just return a message instead of a file.}

\item{base_url}{URL for the AMOS frontend.  Used to construct the internal links in the output file.}

\item{dtxsids}{List of DTXSIDs to search for.}

\item{include_classyfire}{Flag for whether to include the top four levels of a ClassyFire classification for each of the searched substances, if it exists.}

\item{include_external_links}{Flag for whether to include database records that are purely external links (e.g., spectra that we can link to but cannot store directly in the database).}

\item{include_functional_uses}{Flag for whether to include functional use classifications based on the ChemFuncT ontology.  Only exists for around 21,000 substances in the database.}

\item{include_source_counts}{Flag for whether to include counts of a substance's appearances in patents, PubMed articles, and other external sources.}

\item{methodologies}{Filters the returned results by analytical methodologies.  This argument should be a dictionary with four keys with boolean values -- "all", "GC/MS", "LC/MS", and "NMR".  There are some methodologies with small numbers of records (e.g., IR spectra) which will only appear in the data if "all" is set to true.}

\item{record_types}{Filters returned results by record type.  This argument should be a dictionary with three keys with boolean values -- "Fact Sheet", "Method", and "Spectrum".  Note that the "Spectrum" flag will return spectra of all types -- mass, NMR, etc.}
