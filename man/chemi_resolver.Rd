\title{Resolve chemical identifiers using an external API.}
\usage{
chemi_resolver(query)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A character vector of chemical identifiers to resolve.}
}
\value{
A list containing the resolved chemical names. Each element of the list
corresponds to an identifier in the input \code{query}.  Returns an empty list if the
API returns no results for a given query.
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of chemical identifiers as input and uses an external API
to resolve them. It sends a POST request to the API endpoint, passing the identifiers
in the request body. The API response is then parsed to extract the 'chemical' field
from each returned object.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example usage with a single identifier:
resolved_name <- chemi_resolver(c("aspirin"))
print(resolved_name)

# Example usage with multiple identifiers:
resolved_names <- chemi_resolver(c("aspirin", "ibuprofen", "water"))
print(resolved_names)
}
