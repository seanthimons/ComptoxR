\usage{
genra_neighborhood(
  query,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A single DTXSID (in quotes).}

\item{fp}{A fingerprint to search by. Defaults to Morgan fingerprints.}

\item{sel_by}{Select compounds by data sources. Defaults to \code{ToxRef}database.}

\item{n}{Number of nearest neighbor to search for. Defaults to 12}
}
\value{
Returns a tibble with results. First row is the searched compound.
}
\description{
Performs a neighborhood expansion for a single DTXSID. Effectively a wrapper that combines \code{genra_nn()} + \code{ct_details()} and returns a cutdown table for further analysis.
