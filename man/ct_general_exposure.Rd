Get SEEM General Exposure Prediction
}
\details{
These are estimates of the average (geometric mean) exposure rate (mg/kg bodyweight/day) for the U.S. population. We are 50\% confident that the exposure for the chemical is below the median estimate, and we are 95\% confident that the average exposure rate is below the upper 95th percent estimate. Total population predictions are based upon consensus exposure model predictions and the similarity of the compound to those chemicals monitored by NHANES. The method for the total U.S. population was described in a 2018 publication, "Consensus Modeling of Median Chemical Intake for the U.S. Population Based on Predictions of Exposure Pathways".
