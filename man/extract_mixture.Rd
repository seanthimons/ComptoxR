\title{Detects chemical mixtures by name based on ratio patterns}
\usage{
extract_mixture(name_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{name_vector}{A character vector of chemical names to search.}
}
\value{
A logical vector of the same length as \code{name_vector}. Returns \code{TRUE}
if a ratio pattern is found, \code{FALSE} if not, and \code{NA} for \code{NA} inputs.
}
\description{
This function searches a vector of chemical names for patterns indicating a
ratio, such as "(1:1)" or "(2:1)". It is useful for identifying potential
mixtures that might not be flagged by other means. The search is robust to
extra whitespace.
}
\examples{
test_names <- c(
  "Ethanol, water (1:1)",
  "Sodium chloride",
  "Styrene-butadiene copolymer (3:1)",
  "A name with extra spaces ( 2 : 1 )",
  "A name with decimals (1.5:1)",
  "1,2-Dichlorobenzene", # Should be FALSE
 "Mixture (3:1 w/w)",
  NA
)
extract_mixture(names)
test_names \%>\% enframe(., name = 'idx', value = 'name') \%>\% mutate(bool_mix = extract_mixture(name))
# Expected output: TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, NA
